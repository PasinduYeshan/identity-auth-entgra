# Device attribute based authentication with WSO2 Identity Server
Our goal is to secure the user by considering security aspects of mobile device and based on this device information 
we can decide to authenticate the user with minimal steps, improving the user experience or step up or even block access 
if the device is in an unsecured state.

## Getting started
* To download and integrate the Extension into the Identity Server follow the instructions [here](files/artifact.md).
* To get started with the Entgra conditional authentication function, Go to [configuring Entgra conditional 
  authentication](files/config.md).
